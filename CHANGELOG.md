## [Unreleased]

### Added (PR #5 — 8 skills + calibration source + validator extensions)

- `skills/task-breakdown/SKILL.md` — P0 skill consumed by `@lead`. Decomposes intent into a task graph with SP estimates, owner assignments, and dependency edges. Includes SP rubric (1/2/3/5/8/13) and 6-step decomposition flow.
- `skills/project-discovery/SKILL.md` — P0 skill consumed by `@product` and `@lead`. Returns `{ has_source, primary_language, framework, scope_hints, mode }` snapshot. Language/framework signature tables; brownfield/greenfield classifier.
- `skills/code-review/SKILL.md` — P0 skill consumed by `@reviewer`. Severity-graded review (Critical/Major/Minor/Nit), per-language gates via `rules/<lang>/`, security/performance checklists, 80% confidence threshold, 5-signal confidence rubric.
- `skills/qa-test-planner/SKILL.md` — P0 skill consumed by `@test`. Maps CONTRACT criteria to probes via orchestra-probe MCP; 4-axis coverage strategy (happy/boundary/error/idempotency); 8 standard adversarial fuzz patterns.
- `skills/commit-work/SKILL.md` — P0 skill consumed by `@ship` and `/orchestra commit`. Conventional Commits 1.0.0 type/scope/subject/body/trailer formatter with repo-specific scope conventions (infra, hooks, mcp, agents, skills, rules, command, spec, validators).
- `skills/write-contract/SKILL.md` — P0 skill consumed by `@lead`. CONTRACT-NNN.md authoring: weighted criteria (sum to 100), `critical:` flag semantics, Probe DSL (status / body_contains / rows_count / etc.), `passing_score:` policy.
- `skills/evaluator-tuning/SKILL.md` — P0 skill consumed indirectly by `@evaluator` via the val-calibration hook. Wraps the calibration source with verdict semantics (PASS/FAIL/pending) and an 8-case boundary index.
- `skills/evaluator-tuning/references/calibration-examples.md` — **Load-bearing.** Read by `hooks/scripts/val-calibration.js` on every `Task(subagent_type=evaluator)` spawn and prepended as `<calibration-anchor>...</calibration-anchor>`. Contains 8 worked PASS/FAIL/pending boundary cases per DESIGN-002-leaves §6.3 (empty-body assertion, near-timeout, partial-pass weighting, replay attack, redirect chain, redacted DB field, critical-fail outranking probes, drift mid-test).
- `skills/java-source-intel/SKILL.md` — P1 skill consumed by `@backend` on Java/Spring projects. ripgrep recipe library: caller graphs, `@Transactional` boundary scans, JPA entity impact, Spring component injection sites, common refactor scans.
- `scripts/validate.js` — extended to walk `skills/*/SKILL.md`. Asserts: frontmatter has `name`/`description`/`origin`; `name` === parent folder; description ≤200 chars; body ≤400 lines. Frontmatter parsing reuses `hooks/lib/yaml-mini.js`.
- `scripts/test-hooks.js` — val-calibration assertion flipped from passive (PR #3 graceful no-op: "no `updatedInput`") to active. Now asserts: calibration source exists, `updatedInput.prompt` contains `<calibration-anchor>` + `</calibration-anchor>`, original prompt preserved at end.
- `manifests/install-modules.json` += 8 skill entries (`skill.task-breakdown`, `skill.project-discovery`, `skill.code-review`, `skill.qa-test-planner`, `skill.commit-work`, `skill.write-contract`, `skill.evaluator-tuning`, `skill.java-source-intel`).
- `manifests/runtime-toggles.json` += 8 env-var toggles 1:1 with the install-modules entries (`ORCHESTRA_SKILL_*`).
- test-removability now reports **15 modules / 15 toggles** (7 from PR #1–#4 + 8 skills). Final v1.0.0 count after PR #6/#7 will be 36 modules / 15 toggles per R10 Option A scope.

### Changed (PR #5)

- `docs/PRD-001.md` — revision 4. §8.7 amendment per T-PA-01 (R10 resolution): env-var toggles cover only **skill / hook / MCP**. Agents toggle via `plugin.json.agents` removal; rules via `paths:` glob editing; commands via `plugin.json.commands` removal.

### Added (PR #4 — MCPs orchestra-fs + orchestra-probe)

- `scripts/mcp-servers/orchestra-fs.js` — MCP server exposing one tool: `tree`. Stdlib `fs.readdir` walker producing tree-style output. Path-escape rejection (`..` outside cwd). Ignore globs default to `node_modules`, `.git`, `.venv`. Honors `ORCHESTRA_MCP_ORCHESTRA_FS=off`.
- `scripts/mcp-servers/orchestra-probe.js` — MCP server with two tools:
  - `http_probe`: HTTP/HTTPS request via `node:http`/`node:https`. Configurable timeout, max_body_bytes (truncation), follow_redirects. Response headers filtered (`Set-Cookie`, `Authorization` stripped). Response body passes through 8-pattern secret-redaction.
  - `db_state`: SELECT-only enforced via first-significant-token check. Per-row body redaction. Row cap default 100 (max 1000). Timeout default 5s (max 30s). DSN credentials masked in any log output.
  - **R4 decision**: WITH/CTE rejected in v1.0.0 (CTE rejected with same SELECT-only message). Conservative because PostgreSQL allows DML inside CTEs (`WITH ... INSERT ...`). v1.1+ extends with proper SQL parsing.
  - **Scope reduction**: PostgreSQL and MySQL DSN dispatchers throw a clear "deferred to v1.1+" message. The MCP API surface (DSN format, tool schema) is locked now; v1.1 only adds CLI dispatch.
- `scripts/test-probe.js` — 25+ assertions: redact() unit, http_probe round-trip (status, body redaction, timeout, body truncation), db_state on tmp sqlite (parameterized SELECT, redaction in result, row_cap, INSERT rejected, WITH rejected, comments-before-SELECT allowed, postgres/mysql deferred messages), treeImpl path-escape, MCP JSON-RPC `tools/list` smoke for both servers, env-var opt-out.
- `.claude-plugin/.mcp.json` — registers both servers via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — added `hooks` and `mcpServers` references (lazy until corresponding files arrived).
- `.gitignore` — `scripts/mcp-servers/*` allow-list per PRD §11.3 (only the 2 shipped MCP scripts tracked).
- `manifests/install-modules.json` += 2 mcp entries; `manifests/runtime-toggles.json` += 2 toggles. test-removability now reports 7 modules / 7 toggles.
- `package.json` — added `test:probe` to npm test chain. CI now runs 8 validators.

### Added (PR #3 — remaining 4 hooks + metrics tests)

- `hooks/scripts/pre-write-check.js` — Blocker hook. Detects 8 secret patterns (AWS keys, GitHub PATs, JWTs, RSA/EC private keys, Slack tokens, Google API keys, Bearer/Basic auth) and exits 2 on hit. Skips lines containing `process.env.`, `${`, `placeholder`, `<your-`, `example`, `test-fixture`. Per PRD §9.9 / DESIGN-001-infra §3.2.
- `hooks/scripts/post-bash-lint.js` — Observer hook. Surfaces source-modifying Bash commands (`npm/yarn/pnpm install`, `sed -i`, `tee`, source-file redirects) to stderr. Exits 0 always.
- `hooks/scripts/val-calibration.js` — Rewriter hook. Injects `<calibration-anchor>` block into `@evaluator` Task prompts when the calibration source file exists. Graceful no-op until `skills/evaluator-tuning/` ships in PR #5.
- `hooks/scripts/metrics-collector.js` — Observer hook (multi-event). Subscribed to UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse(Task), PreToolUse(mcp__orchestra-*), SubagentStop, Stop. Routes by `hook_event_name` to one of 5 event types; appends to `<cwd>/.claude/.orchestra/metrics/events.jsonl`. 50MB rotation with 5-archive retention; configurable via `ORCHESTRA_METRICS_ROTATE_BYTES`.
- `scripts/test-metrics.js` — JSONL append safety (100 sequential), rotation (gzipped archive at threshold), retention (≤5 archives), event classification (6 cases), env-var opt-out.
- `hooks/hooks.json` — full hook registration: 5 hooks across 6 event types/matchers.
- `manifests/install-modules.json` += 4 hook entries; `manifests/runtime-toggles.json` += 4 toggles. test-removability now reports 5 modules / 5 toggles.
- `package.json` — added `test:metrics` to npm test chain.
- `scripts/test-hooks.js` — extended with pre-write-check (5 cases incl. Edit-tool branch), post-bash-lint (3), val-calibration (5).

### Added (PR #2 — hash-stamper + validate-drift)

- `hooks/lib/yaml-mini.js` — frozen-grammar YAML parser/serializer (PRD §8.13).
- `hooks/lib/section-hash.js` — canonical SHA256 over normalized section content. Shared by hash-stamper and validate-drift.
- `hooks/scripts/hash-stamper.js` — PreToolUse hook that stamps section hashes into orchestra artifact frontmatter; resolves `references[].hash-at-write: TBD` from upstream artifacts.
- `hooks/hooks.json` — registers hash-stamper for Write/Edit/MultiEdit.
- `scripts/validate-drift.js` — full drift-detection algorithm replacing PR #1's empty-tree stub. Walks artifacts, recomputes hashes, classifies findings (drift-on-confirmed → fail; drift-on-inferred → warn).
- `scripts/test-hooks.js` — yaml-mini round-trip + section-hash regression + hash-stamper integration + validate-drift fixture cases (clean / drift-on-confirmed / drift-on-inferred) + env-var opt-out.
- `docs/pipeline-schema.md` — type-specific frontmatter shapes for every artifact type per PRD §10.5.
- `manifests/install-modules.json` += `hook.hash-stamper`; `manifests/runtime-toggles.json` += `ORCHESTRA_HOOK_HASH_STAMPER`.

### Added (PR #1 — manifests + CI scaffold)

- `manifests/install-modules.json`, `manifests/runtime-toggles.json`, `manifests/known-models.json`.
- `schemas/` IDE-time JSON Schemas for the three manifests.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` minimal scaffold.
- `scripts/validate.js`, `scripts/test-removability.js`, `scripts/test-hooks.js`, `scripts/test-agents.js`, `scripts/test-bash-strip.js`, `scripts/validate-drift.js`.
- GitHub Actions CI running all six validators on every push and PR.
- `.gitignore` for `node_modules`, `.venv/`, and consumer-side `.claude/.orchestra/{local.yaml, metrics, sessions}` per PRD §11.2.

## [1.0.0] — TBD

Initial release. See [`docs/PRD-001.md`](docs/PRD-001.md) for the full v1.0.0 scope.
